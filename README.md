# voutliner.vim

*voutliner.vim* is a simple outliner for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim"). It's mostly tailored for my own needs but I figured that it might be useful for someone else too. The syntax is based around a four space indentation, contains nine levels and should work with most colorschemes. The default file extensions are `.otl` and `.oln`.
