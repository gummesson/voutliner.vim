# voutliner.vim

*voutliner.vim* is a simple outliner for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim"). It's mostly tailored for my own needs but I figured that it might be useful for someone else too. 

The syntax is based around two space indentation, contains nine levels and should work with most colorschemes. The default file extensions are `.otl` and `.oln`.

First levels should end with `:` in order to trigger the folding. All the other levels should start with a `-`. Comments need to start on a new line and begin with `//`.
